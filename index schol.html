      <p class="text-muted">Many people today understand the church as a building. This is not a biblical understanding of the church. The word “church” is a translation of the Greek word ekklesia, which is defined as “an assembly” or “called-out ones.” The root meaning of church is not that of a building, but of people. It is ironic that when you ask people what church they attend, they usually identify a building. Romans 16:5 says, “Greet the church that is in their house.” Paul refers to the church in their house—not a church building, but a body of believers.

    <p class="text-muted">The school library is a really important part of every school. I think every school should have a library with good books so that students can gain extra knowledge. In our school, we have a school library and this is pretty big with more than ten thousand books in it. </p>
